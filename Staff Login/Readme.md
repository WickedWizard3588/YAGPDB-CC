# Staff CC

How many times have you had your staff cheating on you, telling that they were working or Moderating, but actually done nothing?

Many right?

## This CC is partly meant to work with PAGSTDB and YAGPDB.xyz

### If you don't know what PAGSTDB is, it is a Self-Hosted Version of YAGPDB.xyz. Invite it [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=624608566426468373&scope=bot&permissions=2146827775&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpagst.xyz%2Fmanage)

## Advantages of this CC

1. The Main CC, focuses on, checking the timings when your users logged in and logged out.

2. The Interval CC, which is meant to work with PAGST only, checks if the user is Offline during his timings or not. This works with PAGSTDB only, because, YAG doesn't show whether a user is Online/Offline/DND/Idle.

3. This CC is very customizable, you are able to choose over colors, check for perms or check if the user has particular role for adding members. You can also give your own understandable UTC Offset, so that the code becomes easy to read.

4. Make sure to update the Prefix in front of the Regex to your Server Prefix, else, the Run Count will go up, but you will get no reply, and the CC will not work.
