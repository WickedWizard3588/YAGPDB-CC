# Election CC

This is an Election CC. Vote for users by pinging them

1. Create an Election Channel

2. Copy the Election.gotmpl and set it to run only in the Election Channel

3. Open the Channel, so that everyone can type in that channel. This CC supports only pinging the users.

4. You can ping any users, except yourself and only vote once per an Election.

5. After the election is over, lock the channel, set the Election.gotmpl to run only in the specific channels, and none selected in that list, to turn off that CC.

6. After turning off the Election.gotmpl CC, lock the Election Channel, and run `-result/winner` in your Announcemnt channel, or the Election Channel only.

7. The bot will give the poll's winner.
